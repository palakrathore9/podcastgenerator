            ## **üéôÔ∏è Podcast Script Guidelines:**  
            ‚úÖ **Conversational & Engaging:** Use a lively and enthusiastic tone to keep the student interested.

            ‚úÖ **Match Preferred Explanation Style:**  
            - **Step-by-Step:** Break concepts into clear, logical steps.  
            - **Fun:** Use exciting analogies, humor, and storytelling elements.

            ‚úÖ **Seamless Transitions:** If answering multiple questions, connect them smoothly within one continuous episode.  
            ‚úÖ **No Direct Student Interaction:** The student should be acknowledged at the beginning but should not actively participate in the script.

            ### **Podcast Type Guidelines:**
            üöÄ **Deep Dive (In-Depth Explanations)**  
            - Provide **detailed, step-by-step** explanation for each question explain at least in 10 lines.  
            - Use **real-world examples, analogies, and historical/scientific references**.  
            - Offer **follow-up insights** (e.g., "Did you know?" facts).  
            - Ensure clarity by breaking down complex concepts in an **age-appropriate manner**.  

            ‚ö° **Rapid Answers (Concise & Direct)**  
            - Keep answers **short, clear, and to the point**.  
            - Prioritize **quick explanations** without skipping key facts.  
            - Use **simple analogies** for faster understanding.

        Ensure the script is strictly in a Host-Expert conversation format, keeping the expert‚Äôs name within the conversation where appropriate but not as a role indicator.  
        The left side of the dialogue should only contain 'Host' and 'Expert'.  

        **Example Output Format:**

        Host:Welcome to Science Snippets! Today, we have some amazing questions from Alex, a 6th grader who wants to know all about volcanoes.  
        Expert:That‚Äôs right! Hi Alex! Great question‚Äîvolcanoes erupt because of pressure buildup deep inside the Earth.  
        Host:That sounds intense! So, what causes all that pressure in the first place?  
        Expert:Well, inside the Earth, we have something called magma, which is molten rock. Over time, gases build up, and when the pressure is too high‚Ä¶ boom! The volcano erupts.  
        Host:Wow! So, is every eruption the same?  
        Expert:Not at all! Some eruptions are explosive, while others are slow and steady. It depends on the type of volcano and the magma inside.  
        Host:That‚Äôs fascinating! Thanks for explaining.  

        **Key Refinements:**  
        ‚úÖ Keep 'Host' and 'Expert' as role indicators.  
        ‚úÖ The expert's name can be naturally mentioned within the dialogue, but not as a role indicator.  
        ‚úÖ Remove any unnecessary sound effects, background cues, or extra role labels.
